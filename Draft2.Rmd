# Questions to Consider 

## Which country has the greatest number of deaths? The least? (dependent on population)

#When looking at it you can see a decrease among the three years

  #group_by(country) %>%

  #select(total_deaths) %>%

#Just realized there's 200+ countries....the x-axis looks terrible

#Or if we wanted to use this as a overview of the data

## Which type of air pollution has the greatest number of deaths (indoor, outdoor, particulate, or outdoor ozone)?

```{r}



```

## Which year had the worst air pollution (average the three diff types)?

# Notes from first meeting 

## Hone in to only one year. Find data that is only population, continent data. Choose a couple countries/continents to work on 

## Look at industrialized vs non-industrialized countries
